# DuoTone PlanGrid Syntax

A double-hue syntax theme for Atom based using PlanGrid brand colors.

DuoTone themes use only 2 hues (8 shades in total). It __tones down__ less important parts (like punctuation and brackets) and highlights only the __important__ ones. This leads to a more calm color scheme, but still lets you find the stuff you're looking for.
